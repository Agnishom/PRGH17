* Now that we have come to the end of the course, it is time to revisit [Evolution of a Haskell Programmer](https://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html).
  * Which stage of evolution are you at?
  * How many of these programs do you understand?

* Here are some Haskell Communities/Resources which you may find interesting:
  * [stackoverflow - haskell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell?sort=votes)
  * [r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/)
  * [Haskell Weekly](https://haskellweekly.news/)

* Some real world stuff:
  * [RealWorld Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/) - Actually using Haskell to develop real world applications.
    * [Trending Haskell Repositories on Github](https://github.com/trending/haskell) - Open source Haskell Projects you might consider working on.

* Here are pointers to some other cool Haskell Stuff that we did not cover in this course:
  * [Lenses](https://artyom.me/lens-over-tea-1) - How do you modify nested data structures without pain?
    * [Zippers](http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers) - What if you wanted to use lists (or say some other data structure), without having to traverse through the beginning everytime?
  * [Generalized Algebraic Data Types](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT) - Algebraic Data Types with more flexibility.
  * [Arrows](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Understanding_arrows) - Another way of expressing computations that happen in a context.
  * [Concurrent Programming](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/concurrent-and-multicore-programming.html) - GHCi comes with a high performance concurrency library.
